 Incident Management Application

## DevOps Containerization Assignment

Welcome to the Bd engineering team.

This repository contains a small three-tier incident-management application. The application is functionally complete, but it has not been prepared for container-based deployment. Your responsibility as the DevOps engineer is to design and implement a reliable Docker-based local runtime for the complete system.

You are expected to understand the application, identify its runtime dependencies, create production-conscious container images, connect the services with Docker Compose, preserve database data, and document how another engineer can operate the environment.

> **Important:** This document describes the application and the expected outcome. It intentionally does not provide the Dockerfile or Compose implementation.

---

## 1. Assignment objective

Containerize and orchestrate the following services:

1. **Frontend** — React application built with Vite
2. **Backend** — Node.js and Express REST API
3. **Database** — PostgreSQL

After your work is complete, another engineer should be able to clone the repository and start the entire application with one command:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

The completed environment must provide:

- A working browser-based frontend
- A healthy backend API
- A PostgreSQL database
- Automatic service-to-service communication
- Persistent database storage
- Environment-based configuration
- Health checks and predictable startup behavior
- Clear operational documentation

---

## 2. Application overview

The application is an **Incident Command Center** used to record and manage operational incidents.

Users can:

- View all incidents
- Create an incident
- Assign a severity
- Change an incident's status
- Delete an incident
- View the number of active incidents

The frontend communicates with the backend through HTTP. The backend stores and retrieves incident records from PostgreSQL.

### Target architecture

```text
Browser
   |
   | HTTP
   v
Frontend service
   |
   | /api/*
   v
Backend service
   |
   | PostgreSQL protocol
   v
Database service
```

The browser should access only the frontend for normal application usage. The frontend runtime should route API requests to the backend service.

---

## 3. Repository structure

```text
incident-management-docker-lab/
├── backend/
│   ├── package.json
│   └── src/
│       ├── db.js
│       └── server.js
│
├── frontend/
│   ├── package.json
│   ├── index.html
│   └── src/
│       ├── main.jsx
│       └── styles.css
│
├── .env.example
└── README.md
```

You will add the required Docker and operational files. At minimum, this will normally include:

```text
backend/Dockerfile
backend/.dockerignore
frontend/Dockerfile
frontend/.dockerignore
compose.yaml
```

You may add supporting files when justified, such as a web-server configuration, startup script, environment template, or additional documentation.

---

## 4. Technical specification

### 4.1 Frontend

| Item | Specification |
|---|---|
| Framework | React 18 |
| Build tool | Vite 6 |
| Language | JavaScript with JSX |
| Package manager | npm |
| Development command | `npm run dev` |
| Production build command | `npm run build` |
| Build output | `dist/` |
| Development port | Vite default, normally `5173` |
| API path used by browser | `/api/incidents` |

The frontend uses relative API URLs such as:

```text
/api/incidents
/api/incidents/:id/status
```

The production frontend container must therefore provide a way to forward `/api` traffic to the backend service, or an equivalent design that does not require hardcoding a host-only backend URL into the browser bundle.

### Frontend package scripts

```json
{
  "dev": "vite --host 0.0.0.0",
  "build": "vite build",
  "preview": "vite preview --host 0.0.0.0"
}
```

### Frontend container expectations

The final frontend image should:

- Build the React application successfully
- Serve the compiled production assets
- Listen on all required interfaces
- Forward `/api` requests to the backend service
- Avoid shipping unnecessary build dependencies in the runtime image
- Return the frontend application for client-side routes where appropriate
- Include a meaningful health check

A multi-stage build is strongly recommended.

---

### 4.2 Backend

| Item | Specification |
|---|---|
| Runtime | Node.js |
| Framework | Express 4 |
| PostgreSQL client | `pg` |
| Module system | ES modules |
| Package manager | npm |
| Production command | `npm start` |
| Development command | `npm run dev` |
| Default application port | `5000` |
| Bind address | `0.0.0.0` |

### Backend package scripts

```json
{
  "start": "node src/server.js",
  "dev": "node --watch src/server.js"
}
```

### Backend runtime behavior

During startup, the backend:

1. Attempts to connect to PostgreSQL
2. Retries failed database connections
3. Creates the `incidents` table when it does not exist
4. Inserts sample records when the table is empty
5. Starts the HTTP server on `0.0.0.0`

The backend also handles `SIGTERM` and `SIGINT` so database connections can be closed during container shutdown.

### Backend environment variables

| Variable | Required purpose | Application default |
|---|---|---|
| `PORT` | Backend HTTP port | `5000` |
| `DB_HOST` | PostgreSQL hostname | `localhost` |
| `DB_PORT` | PostgreSQL port | `5432` |
| `DB_NAME` | Database name | `incidentdb` |
| `DB_USER` | Database user | `incident_user` |
| `DB_PASSWORD` | Database password | `incident_password` |
| `NODE_ENV` | Runtime environment | Not enforced by source |

For a containerized environment, `DB_HOST` must refer to the database service through the Docker network. It must not use the host machine's `localhost` unless the database is intentionally running in the same container, which is not permitted for this assignment.

### Backend container expectations

The backend image should:

- Use an appropriate supported Node.js base image
- Install only required production dependencies in the final runtime
- Use Docker layer caching effectively
- Exclude local dependencies and unnecessary files from the build context
- Run the application using `npm start`
- Listen on port `5000` inside the container
- Run as a non-root user
- Include a backend health check
- Shut down cleanly when Compose stops the service

---

### 4.3 Database

| Item | Specification |
|---|---|
| Database engine | PostgreSQL |
| Recommended major version | PostgreSQL 16 |
| Internal port | `5432` |
| Default database | `incidentdb` |
| Default user | `incident_user` |

Use an official PostgreSQL image rather than creating a custom database image unless you can justify the need.

The database must be configured through environment variables and must use persistent storage.

### Database schema

The backend creates the following logical table:

| Column | Type and behavior |
|---|---|
| `id` | Auto-incrementing primary key |
| `title` | Required text, maximum 200 characters |
| `description` | Text, defaults to empty string |
| `severity` | `low`, `medium`, `high`, or `critical` |
| `status` | `open`, `investigating`, or `resolved` |
| `created_at` | Timestamp with time zone |
| `updated_at` | Timestamp with time zone |

The database data must survive container replacement and normal `docker compose down` operations.

---

## 5. REST API contract

### Health check

```http
GET /health
```

Healthy response:

```json
{
  "service": "incident-backend",
  "status": "healthy",
  "database": "connected"
}
```

The endpoint returns HTTP `503` when the backend cannot query the database.

---

### List incidents

```http
GET /api/incidents
```

Expected response: HTTP `200` with a JSON array.

---

### Create an incident

```http
POST /api/incidents
Content-Type: application/json
```

Example request:

```json
{
  "title": "Checkout API unavailable",
  "description": "Customers cannot complete payment.",
  "severity": "critical",
  "status": "open"
}
```

Expected response: HTTP `201` with the created incident.

Validation rules:

- `title` is required
- `title` must have at least three characters
- `severity` must be `low`, `medium`, `high`, or `critical`
- `status` must be `open`, `investigating`, or `resolved`

---

### Update incident status

```http
PATCH /api/incidents/:id/status
Content-Type: application/json
```

Example body:

```json
{
  "status": "resolved"
}
```

Expected response: HTTP `200` with the updated incident.

---

### Delete an incident

```http
DELETE /api/incidents/:id
```

Expected response: HTTP `204`.

---

## 6. Containerization requirements

Your solution must provide exactly three application services:

- `frontend`
- `backend`
- `database`

Supporting one-time or administrative containers may be proposed, but you must not replace the three required services.

### 6.1 Service networking

Create a Compose network that allows:

```text
frontend -> backend
backend  -> database
```

Use Compose service discovery rather than fixed container IP addresses.

Do not use:

- Hardcoded container IP addresses
- Host networking as a shortcut
- `localhost` for communication between different containers
- A single container containing all three application tiers

Only ports needed by the host should be published.

Recommended host access:

| Component | Suggested host port | Required exposure |
|---|---:|---|
| Frontend | `3000` | Yes |
| Backend | `5000` | Optional but useful for testing |
| PostgreSQL | `5432` | Not required for normal use |

The database should remain private to the Compose network unless external access is explicitly required for debugging.

---

### 6.2 Configuration

Provide a committed `.env.example` containing non-sensitive example values.

Do not commit a real `.env` file containing secrets.

The Compose configuration must support at least:

```env
POSTGRES_DB=incidentdb
POSTGRES_USER=incident_user
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=change_me
BACKEND_PORT=5000
FRONTEND_PORT=3000
```

Database credentials must not be embedded in a Dockerfile or application image.

For this exercise, environment variables are acceptable. In a production platform, secrets would normally be supplied through a dedicated secret-management solution.

---

### 6.3 Persistence

Use a named volume for PostgreSQL data.

The following workflow must preserve incident records:

```bash
docker compose up -d
# Create an incident
docker compose down
docker compose up -d
# The incident must still exist
```

The following command may intentionally delete all data:

```bash
docker compose down -v
```

Document this distinction clearly.

---

### 6.4 Health and startup ordering

Implement health checks for all services where practical.

Minimum expectations:

- PostgreSQL is healthy only when it can accept connections
- Backend is healthy only when `/health` succeeds
- Frontend is healthy only when its HTTP server responds

The backend must not be treated as ready before PostgreSQL is ready. The frontend must not be treated as ready before the backend is healthy.

Do not rely only on container start order. A started process is not necessarily a ready service.

---

### 6.5 Image quality

Your Dockerfiles will be reviewed for:

- Suitable base-image selection
- Deterministic dependency installation where possible
- Efficient Docker layer caching
- Small and appropriate build contexts
- Useful `.dockerignore` files
- Multi-stage builds where beneficial
- Minimal production runtime contents
- Non-root execution where supported
- Clear `CMD` or `ENTRYPOINT`
- No secrets embedded in image layers
- Reproducible builds

Avoid installing debugging tools or unnecessary packages in production runtime images without justification.

---

### 6.6 Reliability and operations

The Compose solution should include sensible restart behavior.

The environment must support:

```bash
docker compose up --build
docker compose up -d
docker compose ps
docker compose logs -f
docker compose down
```

Logs must remain visible through standard container output. Do not write application logs only to files inside ephemeral containers.

---

## 9. Validation commands

Run these commands before submitting your solution.

### Validate Compose syntax

```bash
docker compose config
```

### Build the images

```bash
docker compose build
```

### Start the application

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

### Inspect status

```bash
docker compose ps
```

### Inspect logs

```bash
docker compose logs --tail=100 backend
docker compose logs --tail=100 frontend
docker compose logs --tail=100 database
```

### Test backend health

```bash
curl --fail http://localhost:5000/health
```

### List incidents

```bash
curl --fail http://localhost:5000/api/incidents
```

### Create an incident

```bash
curl --fail -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/incidents \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "title": "Containerization validation incident",
    "description": "Created while validating the Docker environment.",
    "severity": "medium"
  }'
```

### Verify frontend

Open:

```text
http://localhost:3000
```

### Verify persistence

```bash
docker compose down
docker compose up -d
curl --fail http://localhost:5000/api/incidents
```

Confirm that the validation incident still exists.

## 10. Local application execution without Docker

This section helps you understand the application before containerizing it. Docker remains the required final delivery.

### Prerequisites

- A supported Node.js release
- npm
- PostgreSQL running locally

### Create the database and user

Create a PostgreSQL database matching the configured values, or provide your own values through environment variables.

Example defaults:

```text
Database: incidentdb
User: incident_user
Port: 5432
Host: localhost
```

### Run the backend

```bash
cd backend
npm install

export PORT=5000
export DB_HOST=localhost
export DB_PORT=5432
export DB_NAME=incidentdb
export DB_USER=incident_user
export DB_PASSWORD=incident_password

npm start
```

Windows PowerShell example:

```powershell
cd backend
npm install

$env:PORT="5000"
$env:DB_HOST="localhost"
$env:DB_PORT="5432"
$env:DB_NAME="incidentdb"
$env:DB_USER="incident_user"
$env:DB_PASSWORD="incident_password"

npm start
```

### Run the frontend for development

In a second terminal:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

The source frontend uses relative `/api` paths. When running frontend and backend separately without a reverse proxy, you may need a temporary local proxy configuration for development. Do not solve the production container requirement by hardcoding `localhost:5000` into the frontend source.

---

## 11. Troubleshooting expectations

A DevOps engineer is expected to diagnose issues systematically rather than changing files randomly.

### Recommended debugging sequence

1. Validate the Compose model:

   ```bash
   docker compose config
   ```

2. Check container state:

   ```bash
   docker compose ps
   ```

3. Read service logs:

   ```bash
   docker compose logs backend
   docker compose logs database
   docker compose logs frontend
   ```

4. Inspect environment variables inside a service:

   ```bash
   docker compose exec backend env
   ```

5. Verify DNS and service connectivity from inside the relevant container.

6. Verify that the process listens on `0.0.0.0`, not only `127.0.0.1`.

7. Confirm the internal container port and published host port are not being confused.

8. Confirm PostgreSQL data permissions and the volume mount path.

### Common conceptual errors

- Using `localhost` to reach another container
- Assuming `EXPOSE` publishes a host port
- Using `depends_on` without checking readiness
- Storing database files only in the writable container layer
- Running a development server as the production frontend
- Copying `node_modules` from the host into an image
- Reinstalling dependencies on every source-code change because of poor layer ordering
- Baking passwords into images
- Publishing PostgreSQL unnecessarily
- Treating a running container as a healthy application

## 12. Evaluation rubric

| Area | Weight |
|---|---:|
| Functional Dockerfiles | 20% |
| Compose orchestration | 20% |
| Networking and configuration | 15% |
| Health checks and startup reliability | 15% |
| Persistence | 10% |
| Security and image optimization | 10% |
| Documentation and explanation | 10% |

### Bonus consideration

Additional credit may be awarded for well-justified improvements such as:

- Docker BuildKit cache optimization
- Read-only runtime filesystem where practical
- Explicit resource constraints for local testing
- Compose profiles for optional developer tooling
- Automated smoke-test script
- Image vulnerability scanning documentation
- CI workflow that builds and validates the images
- Software bill of materials generation

Bonus features must not make the base solution unnecessarily complicated.

---

## 13. Definition of done

Your work is considered done when a new engineer can perform the following on a clean machine:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd incident-management-docker-lab
cp .env.example .env
docker compose up --build -d
```

You must then be able to:

- Open the frontend
- Create and manage incidents
- Confirm backend and database health
- Review logs
- Restart the environment without losing data
- Remove the environment and its data intentionally
- Understand the architecture and operational commands from your documentation

The goal is not merely to make the containers start. The goal is to deliver a containerized application that is understandable, repeatable, secure by default for a training environment, and straightforward to operate.
